LOD system is very simple and effective.
In "Scripts" folder you can see "TerrainLOD.cs" file. 
You can customize or upgrade LOD system functionality as you wish in future. 

Some actions for change LOD distances:

1. Open the file
2. Change the values of "DistanceLOD1" and "DistanceLOD2" variables
3. Change "UpdateInterval" if you want to switch meshes more fast or slow.
4. Now you must reassign the script to our zones, select meshes and 
   click main menu item "Custom->Assign Terrain LOD".
5. Check LOD variables values in terrain meshes.
